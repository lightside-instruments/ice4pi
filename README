development published by Lightside Instruments AS.

The initial release ice4pi-gpib includes schematic and PCB
design files for KiCAD. The board is based on ice4pi-2.4
extended with gpib4pi GPIB I/O and allows for development of
GPIB bus logic analyzers and more deterministic logic
then a software only bitbang implementation is possible with
