The ethernet4pizero-direct-spi project is open hardware design of a Raspbery Pi
shield that adds Ethernet over SPI connectivity with differential drivers
connected directly to the MOSI and MISO pins of the Raspberry Pi header.
Thus it enables a software implementation to transmit and receive 10BASE-T data.

The project includes schematics and PCB
design files for KiCAD.

The project is published by Lightside Instruments AS
