Assuming you are running on a Raspberry Pi 2-4 or Zero (tested with bullseye):

1. Install all necessary packages to synthesize rot.v and build bit image (rot.bin) for the ice4pi:

 sudo apt-get install yosys fpga-icestorm nextpnr-ice40 flashrom
 make

2. Make sure your Pi has SPI enabled (e.g. use raspi-config)

3. Load the rot.bin file to the shield:

 sudo make load
